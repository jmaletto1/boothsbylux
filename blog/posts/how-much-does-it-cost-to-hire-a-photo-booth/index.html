            <h1 class="focus--h1">How Much Does it Cost to Hire a Photo Booth?</h1>
   <img src="/img/Photo-Booth.jpg" alt="An operator hosting a Photo Booth">
      <p>The question of Photo Booth cost is one we’re asked so often, and honestly we see quite a lot of misinformation online. So the goal of this article is to give you a better idea of how much you’ll need to spend, and what sort of practices you should be looking out for in a Photo Booth Company. So, the first question to ask is:</p>  

      <h2 class="focus--h2">1. Which Photo Booth Do I Want?</h2>
      <p>Photo Booths have come along way from their passport picture, one-in-one-out days. Now, you have far more variety available to choose from. Whilst the traditional <a href="/photo-booth-hire">Classic Booths</a> still remain hugely popular, other options have emerged such as the <a href="/magic-mirror-hire">Magic Mirror</a>, and the <a href="/360-photo-booth-hire">360 Photo Booth</a>.</p>
          <p>For those not familiar, the Magic Mirror is a free-standing 5-foot-4 Mirror that takes portrait photos of your guests. It does not have an enclosure, like the Classic Booths do. Whilst this means that there isn’t anything for your guests to stand under, it does mean you can get a larger amount of guests into each photo. Where the Classic Booths are restricted to 4-5 guests, Magic Mirrors can typically fit up to 15 into their photos. Everyone simply needs to take a step back, until they can all see themselves in the frame! This is also a superior option for those with additional accessibility requirements.</p>
<p>The 360 Photo Booth is another fantastic option. The focus of this service is really on maximising the fun effect, and in fact, doesn’t take photos at all! What it does take however; is 5 second slow motion videos. Up to 6 guests stand on a circular platform, with confetti poppers or dollar blasters in hand, ready for recording. The camera then takes a slow motion video, which produces some simply stunning visual effects. It can also be programmed to create a Boomerang-style effect, which is perfect for social media platforms such as Instagram, Facebook and Snapchat. Guests then receive their video via email, where they are free to upload to whichever platform they desire!</p>

<h2 class="focus--h2">2. How Much Time Do I Need?</h2>
<p>This is a common question that does need some thought put into it. Many people enquire with us, letting us know that their event is running from say, 18:00 – 00:00. But in truth, it’s very unlikely that they’d need the booth for quite that long. For example, guests are unlikely to use the booth if they are having a sit down dinner. So if food is being served from 19:00 – 20:00, why not have the booth open from 8-12 for example? That way, you can always add an extra hour’s service at the end of the night, should you desire. Additional hours purchased on the night are usually chargeable at £100.</p>
<p>Also consider whether you need any idle time. For instance, if the Booth is going to be opening at 20:00, but you’d like it to be set up and ready for 18:00 – this is something you will need to factor into the cost. Most Photo Booth companies will only arrive an hour before they are due to start, unless otherwise instructed. Idle hours are usually rateable at £25.00 per hour. So if you’d like the booth to be set up 2 hours early, you’ll need to factor in an additional £50.00 to the Photo Booth cost.</p>

<h2 class="focus--h2">3. What's Included?</h2>
<p>With each standard package – we include a range of perks that are guaranteed on the night. This includes:
</p>

<p>
  <ul>
    <li>Unlimited Visits to the Booth</li>
    <li>Double Prints (This means 2 copies of each print. Please note that the 360 Booth produces videos, not photos).</li>
    <li>Booth Specialist to take care of all of your guests on the night.
    </li>
    <li>Full use of our extensive set of Props</li>
    <li>Full Set Up, Operation & Breakdown</li>
    <li>Fully Bespoke Template</li>
    <li>Online Gallery</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<div class="h2 focus--h2">4. What Additional Add-ons Should I Consider?</div>
<p>With each service, there are a number of additional extras that can be added.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Guestbook - £100.00</li>
  <li>Additional Social Sharing Station - £100.00</li>
  <li>USB of Photos/Videos - £20.00</li>
  <li>Custom Exterior Skins - POA</li>
  <li>Multi-Day Hire - POA</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="focus--h2">Summary </h2>
<p>We hope this has provided somewhat of an overview of the costs associated with hiring the above services. As a rule of thumb, in London, the base rate for Photo Booths and Magic Mirrors starts at £450.00, and £550.00 for the 360 Photo Booth. If you need to add additional hours, idle time, a Guestbook or a Sharing station, be sure to factor these in to your budget.

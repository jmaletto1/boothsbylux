            <p>Did you know that we are currently offering free zoom call consultations for all new and existing clients? Planning an event in these times can be hard – which is why we want to support you through the entire process. In previous years, it would have been far easier to see our products and services in person – perhaps at an event or wedding showcase. But with this currently not being possible, we feel it pertinent to offer a greater level of guidance through the booking process so that you can be sure you are booking the best package possible.</p>
            <p>Whether you are interested in a Photo Booth, Magic Mirror, 360 Photo Booth, Uplights or a DJ, allow us to run you through the ins and outs of each service, and what it can do for you. Moreover, via screen-sharing, we can actually provide even more depth into certain aesthetic features such as template design – which would not have been possible in a non-remote scenario. Now, you can see your template being designed and updated in real-time, which ultimately means that your vision is far more likely to be achieved to the nth degree.</p>
            <p>What’s more, we are currently also suspending the charging of a booking deposit and all bookings for 2021, and the first half of 2022. So if venues are unable to open, or your Wedding, conference or special event is unable to take place for any other reason with more than a month’s notice – you don’t need to worry about contacting us for a refund, as you won’t have paid anything. There is also no booking contract to sign, just a short form that provides us with the details of your event. This includes the date, type of event, venue, address, timings, services and best contact on the day. This will hold your date for you in our diary.</p>
        <p>4 weeks before the date of the event, we will follow up to confirm the event is going ahead. If it is, we will then arrange for the final payment and booking agreement to be taken care of. What’s more, if your event has to be postponed or re-arranged in that 4 week timeline, we will still allow you to re-arrange all services with us, free of charge. If we are unable to fulfill the new date, a refund will be provided. *Please note, special holidays such as Christmas Eve, Christmas Day, New Year’s Eve and New Year’s Day are not included in this offer. These terms will remain under review as the landscape of COVID-19 continues to develop.</p>
    <p>So what have you got to lose? Contact us today to book your Photo Booth Hire in London, Hertfordshire, Essex or beyond. We would love to bring a little magic to your special day.</p>

   <img src="/img/blog/the-best-types-of-photo-booth.jpeg" alt="Two ladies using a Magic Mirror Photobooth">
<p>Photo Booths have come a long way from just being a booth that you sit in and take one solitary picture with! There are now so many options to choose from for your Wedding, Corporate Party, or private function. So we figured, what better way to show you our favourite choices than with an infographic! We’ve put together what we think are the 5 best types of photo booth for an event in 2020, 2021 and even leading into 2022.</p>
<p>In the image below, we’ve done our best to give you a quick idea of what each booth looks like, what it does and which events it might be most suitable for. The items in this infographic are: Classic Photo Booths (Oval style), Magic Mirrors, 360 Photo Booths, Roaming Photo Booths and the Self-service Selfie pods. For a more descriptive summary of each service, please scroll down past the infographic for more information, or <a href="/contact-us/">Contact Us</a>.</p>

<p>This may leave you with some questions regarding which types of photo booth might be best for your event, so we’ve put together some pointers below:</p>

<h2 class="focus--h2">Photo Booth</h2>
<p><span class="blog__text--bold">Great For:</span> Events with suitable space, when you want to have an enclosure (holding up to 6 guests), and when you wish to have your photos set up in a landscape format. Also a great option for Green Screen pictures.</p>

<h2 class="focus--h2">Magic Mirror</h2>
<p><span class="blog__text--bold">Great For:</span> Events with less space, when you do not want to have an enclosure (meaning you can get up to 15-20 people into the photo), and you wish to have your photos set up in a portrait format. This is popular with brides, as it means you can fit your whole dress into the pictures. This service also allows guests to sign their prints. You will need to make sure your venue has a lift if the room is not on the ground floor, as the Magic Mirror can not be carried up stairs.</p>

<h2 class="focus--h2">360 Photo Booth</h2>
<p><span class="blog__text--bold">Great For: </span>Any event where you really want to maximise the fun element, and have at least 3 metres by 3 metres space available. These Booths take a slow motion video that can be instantly uploaded to social platforms such as Instagram, Facebook and Snapchat. These booths have been extremely popular at the Oscars and Grammy’s in recent times!</p>

<h2 class="focus--h2">Roaming Photo Booth</h2>
<p><span class="blog__text--bold">Great For: </span>When you want something that is a mix between a Photo Booth and a Photographer. This booth allows the operator to take pictures of your guests anywhere in the venue, be it the dance floor, bar or drinks reception!</p>

<h2 class="focus--h2">Selfie Pod</h2>
<p><span class="blog__text--bold">Great For: </span>Any event that does not require an operator. These booths are fully self service, meaning that guests simply touch the screen and the software takes their pictures automatically. Also the most cost effective option.</p>

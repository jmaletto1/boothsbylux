            <h1 class="focus--h1">The 10 Most Popular First Dance Songs</h1>
   <img src="/img/first-dance-low-angle.jpeg" alt="First Dance at a Wedding.">
<p>The First Dance is one of the most highly anticipated points in any Wedding. In fact, its’ history can actually be dated as far back as the 17th Century in France, where it was known as “the minuet” (or <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_dance">“Queen of Dances”</a>). Simply put, the First Dance represents the newlyweds’ first time dancing together as a married couple. As such, you need to make sure you’ve chosen the right song for your special moment. This is where we come in! Read on for our pick of the Most Popular First Dance Songs.</p>
<h2 class="focus--h2">First Dance Songs - Choreographed or Slow Dance?</h2>
<p>100 Years ago, in the Roaring Twenties, it was common for newlyweds to engage in the act of Ballroom Dancing for their first dance. As this is clearly not a skill most of us possess in modern times, you may want to consider something a bit simpler. Some couples opt to engage in dance lessons with their partner, perfecting the routine that will later become their trademark performance. But it really is up to you – depending on how much attention you want on you during said performance. Most couples opt to go for something slow and romantic, which is a great choice if you just want to be in the moment and not go too over the top.</p>
<p><span class="blog__text--bold">Pick a song that is important to you.</span></p>
<p>There is no doubt that for the rest of the night, the bulk of the music you choose will need to be catered towards anthems that will keep the dance floor busy. But this does not apply to the First Dance. Do not worry for one second about whether the guests know the song or not – it’s totally irrelevant. Guests are so swamped up in the romanticism of the moment (and most likely recording), that they won’t really be focusing on the lyrics anyway; so, be sure to select a song that is important to both of you, this really can’t be stated highly enough!</p>

<p><span class="blog__text--bold">Don't Feel as Though You Have to have One.</span></p>
<p>Whilst they are a common part of Wedding Receptions – that doesn’t necessarily mean that you have to one. As many as 1 in 10 of the Weddings that we perform at do not have a traditional first dance. So if you really don’t want all of the attention to be on your dance moves, you can easily arrange to have your first dance include all of your guests on the dance floor at the same time.</p>

<p><span class="blog__text--bold">Last Dance Songs - Also worth considering.</span></p>
<p>Whilst Brides and Grooms to be will always consider what they want to have played for their First Dance, too often the Last Dance is totally overlooked. But it shouldn’t be! Ultimately, this is the last memory that your guests will have from your special day. So make sure it’s a great one!</p>

<p>Now with the Last Dance, the requirements are very different from the First Dance. As we mentioned earlier, the first dance needs to be a song that is important to both of you, but not so much to your guests. The Last Dance is very much the opposite. Generally speaking, guests need to know the song (it should also be one that you enjoy). Here are our 5 favourite Last Dance Tracks:</p>

<h2 class="focus--h2">5. Andy Williams - Can't Take My Eyes Off You</h2>

<h2 class="focus--h2">4. Queen - Bohemian Rhapsody</h2>

<h2 class="focus--h2">3. Journey - Don't Stop Believin'</h2>

<h2 class="focus--h2">Covid Booking Policy</h2> 
<p>Whilst 2020 has naturally been a crazy year, we’ve been thrilled to see a huge spike in brides, birthday boys/girls and party planners getting in touch with us to discuss plans for their events in 2021 and 2022. Naturally, many have asked us if our booking process has changed to reflect the environment we’re all currently living in, and we’re pleased to tell you that it has.</p>
<p>Usually, when we take a booking, we require a 25% booking deposit, which confirms your date. The remaining balance is then due 4 weeks before the date of the event. We do understand however, that plans change, and particularly in this current winter period, you may not even be able to go ahead with your event, depending on the local restrictions at the time.</p>
<p>So with that said, we are currently waiving both our 25% deposit and booking agreement form. If you’d like to book in with us, simply inform us of your date, times, service and contact arrangements on our abridged booking form, and we will hold your date. This will not be a binding agreement – meaning that you are free to rearrange or cancel if required. 28 days before the event, we will be in touch to confirm the event, at which point we would send over our full booking agreement. If something happens in this 28 day period that means the event can’t take place, we will be more than happy to reschedule your date for you.</p>
<p>We hope this provides a little more clarity and ease of mind when planning your Wedding, Birthday Party or Corporate Event in 2021. If you have any further questions about our booking policy, Photo Booth or Magic Mirror services, please don’t hesitate to contact us!</p>

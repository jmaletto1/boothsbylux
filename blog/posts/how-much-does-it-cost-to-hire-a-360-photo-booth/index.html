   <img src="/img/360-Slow-Motion-Booth.jpeg" alt="">
            <p>This is a fantastic question, and one that we are asked multiple times a day here at Booths By Lux. In this short post, we’ll aim to give you a few tips that will help you decide which features you need for your booth, and what you can expect (roughly) to pay for them.</p>
        <h2 class="focus--h2">1. Add a Social Sharing Station</h2>
        <p>For the most part, our 360 Photo Booth service is fully-inclusive. This means that it comes with an operator, props, online gallery and all the kit required for a fantastic customer experience. Users can also very easily share their videos when they finish recording.

            One thing to consider, however, is that if you have a large number of guests at your event, this may lead to longer wait times for guests waiting to use the booth. This is because the sharing section of the process is done straight after the video has finished recording. So whilst this doesn’t matter too much if the guest count is at a small-medium number, if you have large groups waiting to use the booth – the wait time can add up slightly.
            
            By adding a Social Sharing Station to your package, users are directed over to a separate booth once they have finished recording their video – meaning the queue can move on to the next group of users, instead of having to wait for the first group to enter their email addresses, etc! The Social Sharing Station is typically available as an add-on for £100.00.</p>
       <h2 class="focus--h2">2. Consider Adding Dynamic Props</h2>
       <p>Props and Photo Booths have been a sublime combination for over 15 years now. But have you considered adding a set of dynamic props to your package? Our two personal favourites are a dollar-blasting gun, and confetti cannons. Not only are these extremely fun to use (and you look super cool while recording), but the slow-motion effect produced by the booth makes you look like a superstar. Consider adding either of these props to your package. Confetti Cannons are charged at £20.00 per piece, and Dollar Blasters are charged at £20.00 per set of dollar bills (generally good for 10-15 videos).</p>
       <h2 class="focus--h2">3. Decide On How Many Hours You'd Like to Have The Booth.</h2>
       <p>One thing that guests are often unsure about when enquiring for any of our booths is how long they’ll need them for. In reality, you can hire a booth from 1 hour to the entire day if you like. But in our experience, when a booth is on show for any more than 4-5 hours, it doesn’t really get used any more than with a smaller package. If you are running a promotional event, or anything where the guests are turning over throughout the day – this is of course a totally different story. But for Weddings and Private Functions, 4 hours is generally the golden figure. Additional hours are available at £100.00 (up until midnight, costs vary after midnight).

        We hope this provides you with some ideas on which add-ons you should consider including with your 360 Photo Booth package. Base rates start at £395.00 for 2 hours, but we always provide specific quotes tailored to the requirements of your event. Be sure to contact us for more information!</p>

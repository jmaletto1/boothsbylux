         <p>What a year 2020 has been! Not necessarily for all the right reasons of course. Whilst many parties and events have been delayed, for obvious reasons, we’ve recently found that a great deal of conferences, xmas parties and business events are still takin place, just virtually!</p>
<p>People still need to stay connected in these challenging times, which is why having a Virtual Photo Booth is simply a fantastic option to add to your current event itinerary. The premise is simple. Your first port of call is to choose one of our pre-made photo booth templates, and add your text to the design. This could be the date, the name of the event, a birthday, or all of the above! Alternatively, we do also offer a custom template design at a very low cost. That way, you can have a design that matches any theming, or corporate branding that you may already have in place.</p>
<p>Then, you need to decide whether guests will take their photos separately, or in a group. If you choose the solo option, the guests will be directed (this can easily be set up in a Zoom Call, breakout room or landing page) to a dedicated web page, where they will be guided through the process. The guests will simply need to allow the page access to their webcam. Then, they will either take one photo, or up to 4, depending on how many you have chosen for your given template.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you can have up to 4 guests enter the “Photo Booth” breakout room at the same time. With this option, the software will take photos of the 4 guests at the same time (managed by a countdown), and merge the photos into the same template! How cool is that!</p>
<p>As well as having a branded template, we also offer facial recognition software, which allows us to offer virtual props to your guests. This means they can be displayed in the final photos with a variety of funny hats, glasses, wigs and the like. Cool eh!</p>
<p>Virtual Photo Booths are a great, cost-effective way of adding a little fun and interactivity to a purely online event. Get in touch with us today to see how we can spice up your plans.</p>
